This application will create a multitude of npm projects that will depend on every npm package published.  

Why? Well to help protect helpless packages from being unpublished on NPM! Just run this simple application to do your part!  

WARNING: I'm bad at go and this was some late night coding :)  

Example output: https://www.npmjs.com/~ell

Before running make sure you have a logged in npm account on your system.  

To run:  

> go get  
> go build  
> npm-gen-all <out root> <package name base> <author name>  
> Sit back and relax, its gonna be a bumpy ride
